# Analysis on Greenhouse Gas Emissions
<img src="https://github.com/mrowurakwarteng/library-management-system/blob/main/ERD.png"><br>
This project analyses emission of Greenhouse Gases by countries. The Data contains the most recently submitted information, covering the period from 1990 to 2021. 
It contains information on anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of the following GHGs (carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), 
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), unspecified mix of HFCs and PFCs, sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen triflouride (NF3)) 
that are not controlled by the Montreal Protocol.

## Feature List

1. Total emission by each country
   
2. Amount of emissions each year

3. Emissions by each country every year

4. Forecast for future emissions


# Future Enhancements
Data for conditions such as Temperature, Deforestation amongst others that contribute to climate can be studied and their impact analysed to guage the impact on 
climate and the effects on living organism.
